  The true cost of this work. ??first meeting with Shahmen? Can't recall.<br />We purchased a flexible clay and some tools to model the fork for casting {$?}, but it didn’t dry hard enough. On a recommendation we tried sculpey {$16}, a polymer clay that you can set in a domestic oven, but it was too stretchy to get the level of detail we were after. Bec ended up using casting wax {materials free; $40/hr x 3hr} to model the fork. We subsequently met with our mate, artist and man-with-jewellery-casting-know-how, Andrew Christie, a few times to help us out with the process {total cost for Andrew’s time on the fork: $20/hr mates rates x ?hr}. The initial wax model was cast in brass {$39.95} at Pure Casting in Marrickville, and Andrew cleaned and worked the brass until we were happy with it. We took it back to Pure Casting to get another silicon mould of the brass made up, from which 15 wax forks were poured {$}. Andrew worked the bronzes for us, removing the sprue lines, cleaning up and polishing each fork {included in previous costing. Plus just so much being a legend and going above and beyond. Plus Bec and Connie time consulting with Andrew: $40/hr x 3hrs}.  Packaging printing {$} and share of labour on writing this story and product description for the website {$20} plus photography {$20}. Total cost: $ Unit cost $

  <blockquote>The true cost of this work. We came up with the idea of making a votive candle in the shape of the artists on a grassy hill while on residency at Bundanon. We were all getting paid {$400} to be there so I guess we can't charge twice for that labour {free}. <br/> After several unsuccessful attempts to organise a 3D scan of Marcus and Eguene at an action figure making establishment in Parramatta, Andrew Christie {$20/hour at mates rates} who is an artist and a 3D whizz bought a set of new scanning gear {free} which we are trying out with this project. Andrew scanned the artists {2 hours x 2 people @$40/hr} in their dresses one sunny afternoon at SCA {venue free}, while we bought cakes to share {$9} and held cables and made decisions about poses {2 hours x 2 people @$40/hr}. Andrew printed several mock-ups {$40} and poured 2 test moulds in silicon {$40} and Bec had to spend all day in Dural {$20 petrol, 5 hours @$40/hr} at a Jewish family friends' candle-making course {free, because family} with a bunch of hobby mums and the overwhelming smell of French Pear. We had to buy Andrew several beers over the course of making this work, because that's what you do when artist mates are doing you a favour {$17.70}. Bec used sample wax and spinach dye {$XX} and poured 2 test candles {2 hours @$40/hr}, both of which had bubbled surfaces and imperfections requiring repouring. With the delivery of our wax order {$XX}, we can settle into the labour of pouring 20 candles {XXhours @$40/hr}. Packaging printing {$8.80} and share of labour on writing this story and product description for the website {$20} plus photography {$20}. Total cost: $2,065.50. Unit cost $104.</blockquote>
